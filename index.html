            <h3>Step 1: Makeup Remover</h3>
            <p>
              For effective makeup removal, it's best to use a balm and
              definitely not a wet wipe. There are many examples available on
              our product page.

            <h3>Step 2: Cleansing Foam</h3>
            <p>
              Following the motto "double is always better," it's recommended to
              use a water-based cleanser after removing makeup. There are
              various examples available on our product page.

            <h3>Step 3: Exfoliator</h3>
            <p>
              Not every day, but regularly, it's recommended to exfoliate the
              face, neck, and décolleté so that the top layer of the epidermis
              can function, and old skin cells are removed. This allows for
              healthier skin regeneration.

            <h3>Step 4: Toner</h3>
            <p>
              Toner is a crucial step in skincare, helping to balance the skin's
              pH levels and prepare it for subsequent products. It also removes
              any remaining impurities and ensures better absorption of the
              following skincare steps.

            <h3>Step 5: Essence</h3>
            <p>
              Essence is a concentrated formula designed to hydrate and nourish
              the skin deeply. It often contains active ingredients that target
              specific skin concerns, promoting overall skin health and
              vitality.

            <h3>Step 6: Serum</h3>
            <p>
              Serum is a potent treatment with a high concentration of active
              ingredients. It addresses specific skin concerns such as fine
              lines, wrinkles, and pigmentation. Incorporating a serum into your
              routine can enhance the overall effectiveness of your skincare
              regimen.

            <h3>Step 7: Sheet Mask</h3>
            <p>
              Sheet masks are infused with concentrated essences and designed to
              provide intense hydration and nourishment. They offer a pampering
              and relaxing experience while addressing various skin concerns.
              Using a sheet mask regularly can contribute to a radiant and
              revitalized complexion.

            <h3>Step 8: Eye Cream</h3>
            <p>
              Eye creams are specially formulated to address the delicate skin
              around the eyes. They target concerns such as dark circles,
              puffiness, and fine lines. Gently apply a small amount of eye
              cream using your ring finger, tapping it along the orbital bone.
              Incorporating an eye cream into your routine can help maintain a
              youthful and refreshed eye area.

            <h3>Step 9: Face Cream</h3>
            <p>
              Face creams are essential for providing hydration and locking in
              moisture. Choose a cream suitable for your skin type and concerns.
              Apply it evenly to your face and neck, massaging gently in upward
              motions. Daily use of a face cream helps maintain skin elasticity
              and provides a protective barrier against environmental stressors.

            <h3>Step 10: Sun Protection</h3>
            <p>
              Sun protection is a crucial final step in your skincare routine.
              Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF suitable for your
              skin type. Sunscreen helps protect your skin from harmful UV rays,
              preventing sun damage, premature aging, and reducing the risk of
              skin cancer. Make it a daily habit to apply sunscreen, even on
              cloudy days, and reapply as needed, especially if you're spending
              extended time outdoors.
