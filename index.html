              <h3>Step 1: Makeup Remover</h3>
              <p>
                For effective makeup removal, it's best to use a balm and
                definitely not a wet wipe. There are many examples available on
                our product page.
              </p>

            <li class="hotspot-list" id="step2">
              <h3>Step 2: Cleansing Foam</h3>
              <p>
                Following the motto "double is always better," it's recommended
                to use a water-based cleanser after removing makeup. There are
                various examples available on our product page.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="hotspot-list" id="step3">
              <h3>Step 3: Exfoliator</h3>
              <p>
                Not every day, but regularly, it's recommended to exfoliate the
                face, neck, and décolleté so that the top layer of the epidermis
                can function, and old skin cells are removed. This allows for
                healthier skin regeneration.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="hotspot-list" id="step4">
              <h3>Step 4: Toner</h3>
              <p>
                Toner is a crucial step in skincare, helping to balance the
                skin's pH levels and prepare it for subsequent products. It also
                removes any remaining impurities and ensures better absorption
                of the following skincare steps.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="hotspot-list" id="step5">
              <h3>Step 5: Essence</h3>
              <p>
                Essence is a concentrated formula designed to hydrate and
                nourish the skin deeply. It often contains active ingredients
                that target specific skin concerns, promoting overall skin
                health and vitality.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="hotspot-list" id="step6">
              <h3>Step 6: Serum</h3>
              <p>
                Serum is a potent treatment with a high concentration of active
                ingredients. It addresses specific skin concerns such as fine
                lines, wrinkles, and pigmentation. Incorporating a serum into
                your routine can enhance the overall effectiveness of your
                skincare regimen.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="hotspot-list" id="step7">
              <h3>Step 7: Sheet Mask</h3>
              <p>
                Sheet masks are infused with concentrated essences and designed
                to provide intense hydration and nourishment. They offer a
                pampering and relaxing experience while addressing various skin
                concerns. Using a sheet mask regularly can contribute to a
                radiant and revitalized complexion.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="hotspot-list" id="step8">
              <h3>Step 8: Eye Cream</h3>
              <p>
                Eye creams are specially formulated to address the delicate skin
                around the eyes. They target concerns such as dark circles,
                puffiness, and fine lines. Gently apply a small amount of eye
                cream using your ring finger, tapping it along the orbital bone.
                Incorporating an eye cream into your routine can help maintain a
                youthful and refreshed eye area.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="hotspot-list" id="step9">
              <h3>Step 9: Face Cream</h3>
              <p>
                Face creams are essential for providing hydration and locking in
                moisture. Choose a cream suitable for your skin type and
                concerns. Apply it evenly to your face and neck, massaging
                gently in upward motions. Daily use of a face cream helps
                maintain skin elasticity and provides a protective barrier
                against environmental stressors.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="hotspot-list" id="step10">
              <h3>Step 10: Sun Protection</h3>
              <p>
                Sun protection is a crucial final step in your skincare routine.
                Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF suitable for your
                skin type. Sunscreen helps protect your skin from harmful UV
                rays, preventing sun damage, premature aging, and reducing the
                risk of skin cancer. Make it a daily habit to apply sunscreen,
                even on cloudy days, and reapply as needed, especially if you're
                spending extended time outdoors.
